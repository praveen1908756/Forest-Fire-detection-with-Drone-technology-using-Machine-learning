# Forest-Fire-detection-with-Drone-technology-using-Machine-learning
This project can be used to detect forest fire with regular as well as drone images and footage. The model uses CNN algorithm to train on fire dataset and then predicts from the media provided. The entire workflow is hosted in a website made with Streamlit python library.
